# Movie Web App

In the web application, data is obtained from the OMDB API. React.js is utilized for the frontend, while Firebase serves as the backend. A list feature has been incorporated into the application, enabling users to input movie details. This functionality is accessible to all users and allows for the removal of movie details to maintain list accuracy. Additionally, the feature provides a compilation of the best movies.
